# Pocket-Core-Updater

This is a Windows GUI App to help with updating the Analogue Pocket Cores and Firmware. This is still a WIP and I will have a release version published soon! I am working along side of https://github.com/mattpannella and the work he has done here: https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket_core_autoupdate_net to make a Windows Desktop Experince. The Windows App can be run on the Pocket itself or from a Windows Machine.
